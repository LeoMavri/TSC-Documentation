* A **Limited Access** Torn API key 
	* Go to [Torn -> Settings -> API Keys](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=api)
	* Click on "Generate New Key"
	* Select "Limited Access"

* A user script manager installed in your browser

### Desktop

TLDR:
* move to Zen Browser if you're on Google Chrome
* Use tampermonkey
* (not really)

### Mobile - Android

To install the script on mobile, you'll need a browser that supports extension.

My personal recommandations would be:
* Quetta - It's new, but from a bit of use it seems to work fine
* Firefox Nightly - A bit slow, gets the job done
* Kiwi - Unmaitained, but works
* Lemur - Same as Kiwi
* Mises - Works, only reason why it's last is because of the Crypto stuff baked in

### Mobile - iOS

Use TornPDA.
